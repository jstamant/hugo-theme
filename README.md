# hugo-theme

This is the generic theme that I'm using for both
[tabletop.engineering](https://tabletop.engineering/) and
[rogue-technician.com](https://rogue-technician.com/).

## CSS notes

Class and ID reference

A "card" is a post that shows up on a list. I'm using the '.card'
classes to style them.

A "post" is a page dedicated to a single article. I'm using the
'.post' classes to style them.
