This is the custom [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) theme that I've
built for [Tabletop Engineering](https://tabletop.engineering/).

The primary goal of this theme is to load lightning-fast and well-adjusted
(responsive) on all browsers.

I use [Pure.css](https://github.com/pure-css/pure/) to help me design responsive
page layouts. It also sets some reasonable defaults for a bit more consistency
between browsers. This dependency is minimal on overhead, as it only pulls in a
static `.css` file.

I've separated this theme from the
[content](https://github.com/jstamant/tabletop.engineering/) of Tabletop
Engineering in case I apply this theme elsewhere in the future.

Right now, the visual design is lacking, but I'll be looking at improving the
user-experience in the coming future.
